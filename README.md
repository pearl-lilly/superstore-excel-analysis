## Business Questions Addressed
To understand sales, profits, and losses across categories and regions in the Superstore dataset, I focused on the following questions:
1. **What has been the trend in profit by year, and how can it inform future planning?**  
2. **Which categories are generating losses, and what strategies can mitigate these losses?**  
3. **How do sales vary across different sub-categories, and which segments drive the most revenue?**  
4. **What is the regional distribution of sales, and which regions offer the greatest growth potential?**  
5. **Who are the top 5 customers, and how can we enhance relationships with them?**  
6. **How do sales fluctuate by month, and what seasonal trends should be considered for inventory and marketing?**
   
## Excel Skills Used
The following Excel skills were utilized for this analysis:
- **Pivot Tables**  
- **Pivot Charts**  
- **IF and TEXT functions**  
- **Data Cleaning**  
- **Use of Slicers**  
- **Date Functions (e.g., MONTH, YEAR)**

### üìä Dataset Source The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle:  
üîó [Superstore Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)
The dataset used for this project is the ‚ÄúSuperstore Sales Dataset‚Äù, a real-world retail dataset available on Kaggle. It contains detailed transaction-level sales records across multiple regions and product categories.
This dataset is widely used in data analysis and visualization projects, offering a solid foundation for practicing Excel-based business analytics.
It includes information on:
	‚Ä¢	üóì Order and Ship Dates
	‚Ä¢	üì¶ Product Names, Categories, and Subcategories
	‚Ä¢	üìç Regions and Customer Locations
	‚Ä¢	üìà Sales, Profit, Quantity, and Discount
	‚Ä¢	üë§ Customer and Segment Data
## Q1.  What has been the trend in profit by year, and how can it inform future financial planning?
### Skill Used: Pivot Table and Pivot Chart
### Method:
Firstly, my order date was saved as text, so I converted it to a proper date format using the Text to Columns feature and changing the date format. Then, I created a new column named Order Year by extracting the year from the order date using the formula =TEXT([Order Date], "yyyy"). After preparing the data, I created a Pivot Table to summarize profit by subcategory for each year. Finally, I used a bar Pivot Chart to visualize the yearly profit trends clearly.
### Analysis
 ### üí° Insights
- **2014** recorded the highest profit compared to all other years, showing it was the most successful year financially.  
- Across all years, the **Technology** category consistently generated the highest profit among all product categories.  
- This suggests that Technology products are a key driver of overall profitability and should be a focus area for the business.

### ü§î So What

Knowing that **2014** had the highest profit helps the business understand what factors contributed to that success and consider how to replicate them in future years.  
The consistent strong performance of the **Technology** category highlights it as a valuable revenue source, suggesting the business should prioritize investment and marketing efforts in this area to maximize profits going forward.

## Q2 Which subcategories are generating losses, and what strategies can mitigate these losses?
### SkillUsed: Advanced Filter, Pivot Table
### Method:
I used Advanced Filter in Excel to isolate rows where the profit was less than 0, identifying only the loss-making transactions. Then, I created a Pivot Table to summarize total losses by subcategory. This helped me clearly see which subcategories were contributing to negative profit.
### Analysis
### üí° Insights

- The total loss across all subcategories was **‚Äì$156,131**.  
- The top subcategories contributing to this loss were:  
  - **Binders:** ‚Äì$38,510  
  - **Tables:** ‚Äì$32,412  
  - **Machines:** ‚Äì$30,119  
  - **Bookcases:** ‚Äì$12,152  
  - **Chairs:** ‚Äì$9,881  

Chairs, despite high sales, still resulted in a loss, highlighting that strong sales don‚Äôt always translate to profitability.  
High discount rates were a major factor driving losses in these categories.
### ü§î So What
This analysis shows that high discounts are a key reason for the losses. The business needs to review its discount strategy, either by:
- Reducing unnecessary discounts  
- Focusing promotions on higher-margin items  
For subcategories like **Chairs**, where sales are strong but profits are low, improving pricing or cost efficiency could turn losses into gains. This insight can help protect and even improve profitability moving forward.

## Q3.How do sales vary across different subcategories, and which segments drive the most revenue?
### Skill Used: Pivot Table, Pivot Chart
### Method:
I created a Pivot Table with Sub-Category in the Rows area and Sales in the Values area to calculate total sales by subcategory.
Then I used a Pivot Chart (Funnel chart) to visually compare sales across subcategories, making it easier to identify the highest and lowest performing segments.
### Analysis
### üí° Insights
- The total sales across all subcategories was **$2,297,201**.  
- The top 4 subcategories by sales were:  
  - **Phones** ‚Äì $330,007  
  - **Chairs** ‚Äì $328,449  
  - **Copiers** ‚Äì $223,844  
- These top performers accounted for a large portion of the total revenue.  
- Subcategories like **Fasteners** and **Labels** generated the least revenue, contributing very little to total sales.

### ü§î So What
Understanding which subcategories drive the most sales helps the business focus resources where they matter most. Subcategories like **Phones**, **Chairs**, and **Copiers** are key revenue drivers and can be prioritized for:
- Inventory restocking  
- Targeted marketing campaigns  
- Sales promotions  
Meanwhile, lower-performing subcategories like **Fasteners** and **Labels** may need:
- A new marketing approach  
- Better product placement  
- Or even review for discontinuation if they‚Äôre not profitable  

This analysis supports data-driven decisions that can increase overall revenue and operational efficiency.

## Q4. What is the regional distribution of sales, and which regions offer the greatest growth potential?
### Skill Used: Pivot Table, Pivot Chart
### Method
I created a Pivot Table with Region in the Rows area and Sales in the Values area to calculate total sales by region.
Then I used a Pivot Chart (column chart) to visually compare sales across the four regions
### Analysis
### üí° Insights
- **West** had the highest sales at **$725,458**, showing strong performance and customer demand.  
- **East** followed closely with **$678,781**, also indicating solid sales activity.  
- **Central** recorded **$501,240**, showing moderate performance.  
- **South** had the lowest sales, at **$391,722**, despite offering the same product categories.
Sales are unevenly distributed, with the West and East regions leading in revenue.

### ü§î So What
- The company should **maintain momentum** in the **West and East**, as they are top-performing markets.  
- The **South region** presents a clear growth opportunity. With improved marketing, localized campaigns, and better distribution, sales in this region could rise significantly.  
- The **Central region**, with moderate sales, could benefit from **targeted promotions** to push it closer to top-tier performance.
> This insight allows for data-driven regional strategy planning, optimizing resources for both immediate wins and long-term growth.

## Q5 Who are the top 5 most profitable customers, and how can we enhance relationships with them?

### Skill Used: Pivot Table, Pivot Chart
### Method
I created a Pivot Table using Customer Name in the Rows area and Profit in the Values area.
I then sorted the Pivot Table from largest to smallest profit to identify the top 5 most profitable customers.
Finally, I visualized the result using a Pivot Chart (bar chart) to clearly highlight the highest-value customers.
## Analysis
### üí° Insights
The top 5 most profitable customers are:  
1. **Tamara Chand** ‚Äì $8,981  
2. **Raymond Buch** ‚Äì $6,976  
3. **Sanjit Chand** ‚Äì $5,757  
4. **Hunter Lopez** ‚Äì $5,622  
5. **Adria Barton** ‚Äì $5,445  
These customers have consistently purchased high-profit items and likely represent loyal or bulk buyers.
### ü§î So What
Knowing your top customers helps shape customer retention strategies. Here‚Äôs how the company can strengthen relationships and grow profit further:
- Offer loyalty perks (e.g., exclusive discounts, early access to sales)  
- Personalize communication based on past purchases  
- Invite them to VIP programs or feedback loops to deepen engagement  
- Use their buying behavior to create customer personas for similar high-value prospects  
Focusing on these customers ensures repeat business, builds brand loyalty, and drives sustained profitability.

## Q6 How do sales fluctuate by month, and what seasonal trends should be considered for inventory and marketing?
### Skill Used: Pivot Table, Pivot Chart, Date Formatting
### Method
I first extracted the month from the Order Date column using Excel‚Äôs TEXT function:
=TEXT(Order Date, "mmm") to get the month abbreviation.
Next, I created a Pivot Table with the Month as Rows and Sum of Sales as Values.
I then sorted the months based on total sales to identify sales peaks and lows, and used a bar chart to visualize the monthly trend.
### üí° Insights
- September had the highest sales: **$186,130.37**  
- Followed by December: **$180,432.63** and November: **$166,936.41**  
- The lowest sales occurred in February: **$34,046.84**, and January: **$50,718.98**  
This indicates that **Q4 (Sept‚ÄìDec)** is the strongest sales period, likely driven by holiday shopping, end-of-year sales, or Black Friday/Cyber Monday events.

### ü§î So What
Understanding these seasonal patterns helps with planning inventory and marketing strategies:
- Stock up on high-demand items before September‚ÄìDecember  
- Launch campaigns in August to build momentum into Q4  
- Use flash sales or loyalty promotions in low-sales months (e.g., Jan‚ÄìFeb) to boost engagement  
- Align your marketing budget and ad spend with peak seasons to maximize ROI  
This insight supports data-driven inventory decisions and smarter promotional timing.
